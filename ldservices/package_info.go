// Package ldservices provides HTTP handlers that simulate the behavior of LaunchDarkly service endpoints.
//
// This is mainly intended for use in the LaunchDarkly Go SDK's unit tests, but it could also be useful in
// testing applications that use the Go SDK if it is desirable to use real HTTP rather than test fixtures.
